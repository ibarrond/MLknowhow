In order to install the Python Packages required for a generic Data Science build, one could use the generic __Anaconda__, or if you're like me and you hate downloading a lot of useless stuff and controlling your environment and installed packages, you can simplily use this list by putting it into a `requirements.txt` file and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
